                <p>
                        Persian carpets represent a tradition of many centuries in the history of my home country and the surrounding regions. The handmade production is a demanding art and requires skill, practice and a very good eye.
                        To me, the quality of my carpets and the value of this fine handwork is of utmost importance.<br><br>A hand-knotted Persian carpet is quite different from a carpet made by machines, because the craft of carpet knotting takes a lot of time, patience and experience.
                        First of all the loom, which can be either vertical or horizontal, is covered with warp threads, which form the basic structure of the carpet. The material threads are then knotted with the warp threads. After each row of knots, a weft thread is inserted through the warp threads to stabilize the carpet. Knocking down the knots and weft threads increases the density of the knotting. The resulting pile is shortened and the protruding ends of the warp threads form the characteristic fringes of the carpet. The quality of each carpet is carefully checked before it is dried to make the colours last longer and to strengthen the shape. After months or even years of dedicated work this is how the beautiful Persian carpets are created.
                        The quality of Persian carpets is largely determined by the yarn used. For the production of high-quality carpets we use natural materials like cotton, wool and silk. The density of the knots is also important. The more densely the carpet is knotted, the more valuable it is. To achieve the wonderful patterns of Persian carpets we use different coloured yarns, that are dyed by hand with natural pigments. <br><br>
                        Persian carpets can be found in almost all sizes and variations, so that you can find the right carpet in every situation.
                        The handcraft of carpet knotting is an art that must be taught and learned with great intensity. A lot of experience and accurate knowledge enable the making of carpets in best quality. Thus a Persian carpet is never just a carpet, but always a piece of real persian culture.
